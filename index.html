      I heard from a bird that the world lost another one<br/>
      But this one was different<br/>
      This was one you knew very well<br/>
      This was one you loved, and one who loved you<br/>
        
      <br/>
      
      It was time for nature to take him back into her infinite embrace<br/>
      В гостя́х хорошо́, а до́ма лу́чше<br/>
        
      <br/>
      
      The bird sang a short song about him:<br/>
      He lived a long life<br/>
      He lived a full life<br/>
      He played (remember play? oh, how we forget to play!)<br/>
      He learned<br/>
      Worked<br/>
      Fought<br/>
      Loved<br/>
      And lost<br/>
      And he had kids! <br/>
      And one of his kids had more kids! <br/>
        
      <br/>
      
      I wonder if his kids ever thought about how<br/>
      When their dad first looked into their eyes <br/>
      He saw the future<br/>
      The future always comes in the form of a present<br/>
      And so the cycle goes<br/>
        
      <br/>
      
      
      I can’t help but think that in his final hours<br/>
      He thought of you<br/>
      And that your presence in this world<br/>
      Brought him peace, satisfaction, and pride<br/>
        
      <br/>

      And as he began to exit the stage<br/>
      He smiled<br/>

      <br/>
      
      
      After all<br/>
      You were, you are<br/>
      His greatest present<br/>
